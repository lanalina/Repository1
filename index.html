    <h1>Switzerland</h1>

    <div id="Switzerland">
      <p>Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a country situated in western, central and southern Europe[9][note 4].
It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.[1][2][note 1]
The sovereign state is a federal republic bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east.
      </p>

      <p>Switzerland is a landlocked country  geographically divided between the Alps, the <strong><span style="color:blue">Swiss Plateau</span> </strong>and the <em><span style = "color: green">Jura</span></em>, spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi) (land area 39,997 km2
(15,443 sq mi)). While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest
cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. The precursors of Switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century (1291), forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries.

    <h3> Early history </h3>
    <div> The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date back about 150,000 years.[25] The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which were found at Gächlingen, have been dated to around 5300 BC.

    <div id="Economy and labour law">
      <h3>Economy and labour law</h3>
      <p>Switzerland has a stable, prosperous and high-tech economy and enjoys great wealth, being ranked as the wealthiest country in the world per capita in multiple rankings.
      In 2011 it was ranked as the wealthiest country in the world in per capita terms (with "wealth" being defined to include both financial and non-financial assets),
      while the 2013 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report showed that Switzerland was the country with the highest average wealth per adult in 2013.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Military">
      <h3>Military</h3>
      <p>
      The structure of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment, including all personal weapons, at home.
      Some organisations and political parties find this practice controversial.[67] Women can serve voluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18.
      About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of alternative service exist.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Cantons">
      <h3>Cantons</h3>
      <p>
      The cantons are federated states, have a permanent constitutional status and, in comparison with the situation in other countries,
      a high degree of independence. Under the Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status, except that 6 (referred to often as the half-cantons) are represented by only one councillor (instead of two) in the Council of States and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on constitutional amendments.
      Each canton has its own constitution, and its own parliament, government, police and courts.
